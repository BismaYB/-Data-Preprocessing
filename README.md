# Data Preprocessing Project

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to design and implement a robust data preprocessing system that addresses common challenges such as missing values, outliers, inconsistent formatting, and noise. By performing effective data preprocessing, the project aims to enhance the quality, reliability, and usefulness of the data for machine learning.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available at:

Dataset: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F3lRf32JM8ejnXq-Cbf9y7fa57zSHGz_/view?usp=sharing



## Key Components

### 1. Data Exploration

Explored the data: Inspected the dataset structure and data types.

Unique Values: Listed unique values in each feature and calculated their lengths.

Statistical Analysis: Performed statistical analysis (mean, median, standard deviation) on numerical columns.

Renamed Columns: Renamed columns for clarity and consistency.

### 2. Data Cleaning
Missing Values: Identified and treated missing values appropriately
Replaced inappropriate values with NaNs.

Treated NaNs in numerical columns by replacing them with mean or median.

Replaced the value 0 in the 'age' column with NaN.

Duplicate Rows: Removed duplicate rows.

Outliers: Identified and handled outliers in numerical columns.

### 3. Data Analysis

Filtering: Filtered the data to include only rows where age > 40 and salary < 5000.

Visualization:Plotted a scatter plot with age and salary.

Counted the number of people from each place and represented it visually using a bar chart.

### 4. Data Encoding

One-Hot Encoding: Applied to nominal categorical variables.

Label Encoding: Applied to ordinal categorical variables.

### 5. Feature Scaling

StandardScaler: Applied to scale features to have zero mean and unit variance.

MinMaxScaler: Applied to scale features to a specified range (e.g., [0, 1]).

## Insights Gained

After preprocessing the dataset, the following insights were gained:

1.Improved Data Quality: The data was cleansed of missing values, inappropriate values, duplicates, and outliers, resulting in a more reliable dataset.

2.Age and Salary Relationship: A scatter plot revealed the relationship between age and salary, showing trends and potential areas of interest for further analysis.

3.Demographic Distribution: Visual representation of the number of people from each place provided insights into the geographical distribution of the data.

4.Encoded Data: Categorical variables were successfully encoded, making the dataset suitable for machine learning models.

5.Scaled Features: Feature scaling ensured that numerical features were standardized, improving the performance and convergence of machine learning algorithms.

## Conclusion
The preprocessing steps carried out in this project have significantly enhanced the quality and usability of the dataset. These steps are crucial for building effective and reliable machine learning models.
